method refrences:
===================
It is used to reuse the existing method instead of giving new same definition which other method has.
Note:Only works with Functional interfaces.
Some rules:
===========
1.method can be static(className::methodName) or instance method(new className()::methodName).
2.Any modifier in same class but public instance method in any class od any pkg.
3.Any return types.
4.Number of argument and typesof argument should be same.



Constructor references:
=========================
when to use:
==============
Constructor references should use when functional interface abstract method returns class

syntax:
========
ClassName::new


Note:System.out.println

where::
System::final class System
out::final static PrintStream out
println::Instance method of PrintStream class


So we can write it as::System.out::println

this is referencing instance method of PrintStreamclass with ref out.
